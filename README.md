As moutfull as it sounds, but functional it will be, file upload is needed in any application
there for this demo shows how we can upload files directly to our MongoDB using it's GridFS System.

## Instalation:

In order to use this repo, please feel free to clone directly to your working directory and simply enter this command to your Terminal/CMD :

`yarn install`

or, in case your don't dispose yarn, please use the following command:

`npm install`

## Launching the app:

In case you want to run the app, simply use the following command : 

`npm start`


## Smaller Bundle.js File? :thinking:
`npm start` command first compiles jsx files with webpack and then will run node server (see `package.json`)
for more minified and smaller builds try :
```
webpack -p
node app.js
```

`webpack -p` command uses built-in plugin called UglifyJsPlugin that reduces the bundle file size Significantly :+1:


## Not Enough? Try this :smiley:
